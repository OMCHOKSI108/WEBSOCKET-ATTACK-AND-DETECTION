# Security Policy

## Overview

The **DDoS Attack and Detection Simulation** is an educational project developed by **Om Choksi** to simulate various Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks for research and learning purposes. This toolkit includes Python scripts for attack simulation and packet analysis. Security is a critical concern due to the sensitive nature of the tools involved. This policy outlines our commitment to responsible usage, legal compliance, and addressing security vulnerabilities.

> **Disclaimer**: This toolkit is for **educational and research purposes only**. Unauthorized use against systems without explicit consent is illegal and unethical. Users are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

---

## Supported Versions

The following versions of the toolkit are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes            |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No (Deprecated)|

We recommend using the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.

## Responsible Usage Guidelines

To ensure the toolkit is used ethically and legally, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Authorized Use Only**: Only use this toolkit on systems or networks where you have explicit permission from the owner. Unauthorized testing or attacks are prohibited.
2. **Educational Context**: Deploy the toolkit in controlled environments (e.g., virtual machines, private labs) for learning or research purposes.
3. **No Malicious Intent**: Do not modify or distribute the toolkit for malicious purposes, such as launching real-world attacks.
4. **Compliance**: Ensure usage complies with local, national, and international laws regarding cybersecurity and network testing.
5. **Attribution**: If you use or extend this toolkit in your projects, credit the original author (Om Choksi) and retain the MIT License.

Violation of these guidelines may result in legal consequences for the user, and the project maintainers disclaim liability for misuse.

## Security Features

The toolkit includes the following features to promote safe usage:
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly `tkinter`-based interfaces to reduce accidental misuse by novices.
- **Packet Analysis**: A detection tool (`detection.py`) to analyze attack patterns, aiding in understanding and mitigating simulated attacks.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable settings (e.g., `TARGET_IP`, `NUM_THREADS`) to limit scope and prevent unintended escalation.

However, these features do not prevent misuse if deployed irresponsibly. Users must exercise caution and follow the guidelines above.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the toolkit (e.g., a bug that could be exploited or a flaw in the attack simulation logic), please report it responsibly:

1. **Contact**: Email the maintainers at **omchoksi108@gmail.com** with the subject line `[Security Vulnerability]`.
2. **Details**: Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact (e.g., risk of misuse, data exposure).
   - Any suggested fixes (optional).
3. **Confidentiality**: Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly (e.g., on GitHub Issues or social media) until it has been reviewed and addressed.
4. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide a resolution timeline within **7 days**.

We appreciate your help in keeping this project secure and will credit contributors for responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities unless anonymity is requested.

## Vulnerability Management

Upon receiving a vulnerability report:
- The maintainers will assess its severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical) based on potential impact and exploitability.
- A patch or mitigation will be developed and tested in a private branch.
- An updated version will be released with the fix, and the changelog will note the security update (e.g., "Fixed vulnerability in malformed packet generation").
- Users will be notified via GitHub Releases and encouraged to upgrade.

---

## Third-Party Dependencies

The toolkit relies on the following dependencies, which may have their own security considerations:
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you use a supported version with the latest security patches.
- **Tkinter**: Part of Python’s standard library; no additional security updates required.
- **`hping3`**: Required for `syn_udp.py`. Install from trusted sources (e.g., official Ubuntu repositories) and keep it updated.

Monitor these dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit` or by checking their respective security advisories.

---

## Limitations and Risks

This toolkit is not designed for production-grade attack mitigation or defense. Key limitations include:
- **Simulation Only**: It cannot fully replicate real-world DDoS attacks due to scale and complexity constraints.
- **Detection Tool**: `detection.py` relies on user-provided CSV data and may miss sophisticated attack patterns.
- **Platform Dependency**: `syn_udp.py` requires Linux (Ubuntu/WSL), limiting Windows-native support.

Users should not rely on this toolkit as a primary security solution for live systems.
